# Turitrav

There is a small problem in Colombia at the moment and it is that there are few pages or websites that provide tourist help on the different activities that can be found in the country and this can generate problems when looking for what activities to find. Here then why Turitrav was created.

Tutitrav is a platform where you can find many eco-tourist places in different cities and towns of the Andean region in Colombia and also find hotels and accommodations near these beautiful places in the middle of nature.

## Usage
## [Turitrav](https://turitrav.live)

## Development :hammer_and_wrench:

Turitrav has been developed in different technologies and programming languages such as:

### Frontend:

- HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and React

### Backend:

Thanks to this we have been able to design and create a modern, pleasant and dynamic interface for the user, where in an easy way they can use the platform that will make their experience when finding a new place to explore and discover in the middle of nature discovering the richness of :blossom: flora, :bear: fauna, :frowning_woman: culture and :coffee: gastronomy of the Andean region.
